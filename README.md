# vaccine-front

According to the paper *Optimization of vaccinationcenter scheduling and algorithm implementation*, the 0-1 integer programming model of vaccination scheduling problem was established in order to minimize the fluctuation of the number of species in a single day in order to minimize the fluctuation of the number of species in a single day. This project implements the front end of the data generation website. You can use this part of the code to generate front-end pages. Put the generated page into the backend rendering, you can get the data generation website. You can maintain vaccine information in the simulation system and get the *data.json* file.

## How to use

This project needs to install some dependency libraries.

```
npm install
```

If you only want to see the effect of the front page, you can open a rendering service locally.

```
npm run dev
```

If you want to generate a front-end page for use by the backend, you can execute the following command.

```
npm run build
```

## How to develop

You can run unit tests.

```
npm run unit
```

You can also run e2e tests.

```
npm run e2e
```
